                    <h3>Baseball</h3>
                    <p>Baseball has been a significant part of my life, teaching me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of perseverance. Playing varsity baseball in high school helped me develop leadership skills and learn how to work effectively as part of a team. The sport has taught me valuable lessons about setting goals, working hard to achieve them, and supporting my teammates along the way.</p>
                    <p>These experiences on the baseball field have directly translated to my academic and professional life, helping me maintain focus, manage my time effectively, and collaborate with others in group projects and work environments.</p>

                    <h3>Gaming</h3>
                    <p>Gaming is one of my favorite ways to relax and unwind after a long day of classes and studying. I enjoy playing a variety of games, from strategic team-based games to competitive esports titles. Gaming has helped me develop problem-solving skills, quick decision-making abilities, and the ability to work effectively in team environments.</p>
                    <p>Beyond entertainment, gaming has also sparked my interest in technology and how digital platforms can be used for learning and professional development. It's a hobby that balances fun with skill development, and it provides a great way to connect with friends and build relationships.</p>
